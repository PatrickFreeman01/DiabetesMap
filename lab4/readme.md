I would say this was the most trouble ive had with a lab so far. I was struggling a little bit in class with some of the code but I figureded it out. Getting data had some problems, my data didnt start at the first line of my csv so it wouldnt convert to geojson. I had a couple problems with the circle sizes but nothing too hard. The main problems I ran into were trying to do a popup or legend. I'm pretty sure my legend is behind my map right now and I'm not quite sure why. I'm just having problems making it look better or adding on the extra things. I woudlve liked for my map to have a popup. I think I need to start working on my maps earlier in the week. I run into problems that I dont expect to run into and it makes the process longer. Got my popups working. I need to start working on the labs earlier.
